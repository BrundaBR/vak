# The Bird May Die
## Poem by Forough Farrokhzad

I feel sad,
I feel blue.  

I go outside and rub my cold fingers-  
on the sleek shell of the silent night.

I see that all lights of contact are dark,  
All lanes to relate us- are blocked.

Nobody will introduce me to the sun,  
Nobody will take me- to the gathering of doves.

Keep the flight in mind,  
The bird may die.
